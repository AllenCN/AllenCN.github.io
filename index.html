		<p>What I believe I will do on this website is practice web design principles to the best of my ability.</p>
		<p>This includes creating generic webpages, testing out various ways to create CSS styles that look good for what they are.</p>
		<p>I'll even create a few JavaScript applications through the use of this.</p>
