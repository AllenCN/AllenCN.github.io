		<h1>Dragon Ball Z</h1>
		<p>I like this series a lot. Been a fan since I was three. To keep my hobby life somewhat separate from something meant to show my professional skills, I created this series of subpages. Only stuff I could code up will appear here in some respects, along with a brief explanation of what it's supposed to be.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="generatechar.html">A character generator</a> for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzqNmYX2wzXZeC13YWl4d0JhRUk/view?usp=sharing">an RPG style I discovered.</a> Done in JavaScript.</li>
			<li><a href="sigtechs.html">In the same vein as above, this tool is meant to help create a signature technique in this RPG style.</a></li>
			<li><a href="plcalc.html">A power level calculator based off of days long past.</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Yu-Gi-Oh!</h1>
		<p>I watch the series and its spinoffs, and I also have made a few applications over the years to help make gameplay a bit easier. Below you will find links to webpages and applications that feature what I did.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="ygocalc.html">A life point calculator that supports up to four players.</a> Unlike most iterations of this application, I did this in ActionScript 2.0 and Flash.</li>
			<li><a href="media/YGOCalc.jar" download>Click here to download a version of the Yu-Gi-Oh LP calculator application that can support from 2 up to 8 players, if you are interested.</a> Programmed in the Eclipse IDE, using Java's Swing framework. Must have the latest Java installed on your machine to use this.</li>
		</ul>
