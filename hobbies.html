		<h1>Dragon Ball Z</h1>
		<p>I like this series a lot. Been a fan since I was three. To keep my hobby life somewhat separate from something meant to show my professional skills, I created this series of subpages. Only stuff I could code up will appear here in some respects, along with a brief explanation of what it's supposed to be.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="generatechar.html">A character generator for an RPG style I discovered. Done in JavaScript.</a></li>
			<li><a href="plcalc.html">A power level calculator based off of days long past.</a></li>
		</ul>
