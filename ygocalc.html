		<h1>ActionScript 2.0 Yu-Gi-Oh LP Calculator</h1>
		<p>As mentioned on my hobbies page, this was programmed entirely in Flash and ActionScript 2.0. I am merely embedding the SWF on the page and letting the file do the hard work. There isn't much else to say. For further instructions on how to use this tool, click the yellow "How to Use" button.</p>
